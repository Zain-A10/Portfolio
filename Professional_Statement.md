# Professional Statement
I’m an aspiring security analyst driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a commitment to protecting people and data. I use my skills in log analysis, threat identification, Linux, networking fundamentals, and Python automation to break down complex security issues and develop practical defensive solutions. Whether analyzing network activity, investigating vulnerabilities, or improving secure design in projects, I focus on understanding how systems fail—and how to make them stronger, safer, and more resilient.
